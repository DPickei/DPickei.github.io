## Background

Tideman is [CS50's](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) notoriously difficult problem set. Exhausting both [notebook paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/153w21e/finished_tideman_no_coding_experience/#lightbox) and [sanity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/n3vv26/i_officially_hate_tideman/). The problem set has gained notoriety for it's difficulty that CS50 has created a [t-shirt](https://cs50.harvardshop.com/products/i-finished-tideman-cs50-t-shirt) for it's completion. 

It's allure is in the low barrier to entry, but a steep learning curve.

## Problem to solve

TLDR: How do you figure out the winner of an election where every voter ranks each candidate in order of preference?

Full explanation, per the [problem set:](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/tideman/)

"You already know about plurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

But the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/plurality_vote.png){: width="500" height="500" .w-75 .normal}

A plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the right outcome?

There’s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/ranked_choice_vote.png){: width="500" height="500" .w-75 .normal}

Here, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their second and third choices. And now, what was previously a tied election could now have a winner. The race was originally tied between Alice and Bob. But the voter who chose Charlie preferred Alice over Bob, so Alice could here be declared the winner.

Ranked choice voting can also solve yet another potential drawback of plurality voting. Take a look at the following ballots.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/ranked_choice_vote_many.png){: width="500" height="500" .w-75 .normal}

Who should win this election? In a plurality vote where each voter chooses their first preference only, Charlie wins this election with four votes compared to only three for Bob and two for Alice. (Note that, if you’re familiar with the instant runoff voting system, Charlie wins here under that system as well). Alice, however, might reasonably make the argument that she should be the winner of the election instead of Charlie: after all, of the nine voters, a majority (five of them) preferred Alice over Charlie, so most people would be happier with Alice as the winner instead of Charlie.

Alice is, in this election, the so-called “Condorcet winner” of the election: the person who would have won any head-to-head matchup against another candidate. If the election had been just Alice and Bob, or just Alice and Charlie, Alice would have won.

The Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to produce the Condorcet winner of the election if one exists. In a file called tideman.c in a folder called tideman, create a program to simulate an election by the Tideman voting method."

## Core theory behind the problem

Under the hood of our election system is a digraph. With each edge representing a candidates victory over another. In order to avoid the potential of a tie, we must prevent a cycle of edges between nodes in our digraph. That can be a lot to digest all at once as a new concept. Here is what that looks like.

Take Alice and Mike. Two candidates (nodes) competing in an election.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/Alice_Mike_Plain.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal}

In this election are 7 voters. 5 votes are casted to Alice, 2 votes are casted to Mike.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/Alice_beats_mike_no_edges.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

We can use an arrow (edge) pointing from Alice to Mike to illustrate the victory. Alice won against Mike by a margin of 3. So we'll say Alice has an edge weight of 3 against Mike.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/Alice_beats_mike_edges.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

Let's add another candidate to this election, Bob. 

It's still pretty easy to see Alice is our winner, as she beat both Mike and Bob.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/alice_mike_bob_no_cycle.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

But now let's say now that Bob beat Alice. Who wins? 

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/3_person_cycle.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

Despite each candidate having one win and one loss over each other, we can see that Alice beat Mike by the largest margin (5). Therefore, Alice is our winner.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/3_person_cycle_win.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

The concept of this now seems simple. However, when we add more candidates, identifying the largest margin in a cycle does not result in a clear winner emerging. What if our strongest candidates are in a cycle amongst themselves or others?

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/complex_cycle.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

In order to identify a clear winner, we need to eliminate every cycle in this graph.

How do we remove a cycle now? Choosing the strongest edge like we did earlier won't indicate a clear winner. Instead, when we see a cycle, we'll remove the edge with the smallest weight. 

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/removed_weakest_edge.png){: width="2000" height="1000" .w-75 .normal }

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/remove_weakest_edge_complex_cycle.png){: width="2000" height="1000" .w-75 .normal }

After removing all of our cycles. We can see that alice from our first example and candidate D have no incoming edges, making them the 'source node' and thus the winner of our election.

Now what does this look like implemented as code?

## Coding our removal of cycles

### Note

The code below represents a small portion of a [larger file](https://github.com/DPickei/Tideman/blob/master/tideman.c).

### Variables

- Struct `pair` containing an integer `winner` and integer `loser`

- Array `pairs`[^footnote] containing every combination of candidate pairs as a `pair` struct
    - Additionally, our array `pairs` is sorted by strength of victory of one candidate over another, starting with the strongest victories first. This will come in handy when we have to figure out which pair in a cycle is weakest.

- `candidates`, an array of strings containing the candidate names. This makes the indexing of the array associated to a candidate. For example, Alice could be indexed as the 5th spot in the candidates array. So if we have `pairs[n].winner` = 5 and `pairs[n].loser` = 6, we know that in this pairing, Alice beat whoever candidate #6 is.

- Integer `MAX` representing the total number of candidates our code will accept.
    
Now let's assume we already have our voting outcomes tracked for each pairing. We now want to lock in the pairings that don't create a cycle. So we'll:
1. Create an empty matrix called `locked`
    - `bool locked[MAX][MAX];`
2. Temporarily add a single pairing from `pairs` to `locked`
    - This is why it's helpful to have our array `pairs` sorted in ascending order beforehand. We can assume that if a pairing creates a cycle, it will be weakest edge of the cycle, so we can delete it without needing to search for the weakest edge.
3. See if our pairing creates a cycle in `locked`
4. If a cycle is not created, we'll permanently add our pairing to `locked`

Think of our matrix `locked` looking like the following initially: 

![Desktop View](/assets/images/tideman_images/empty_nodes.png){: width="300" height="300" .w-75 .normal }

### Implementation

Assume all variables declared and valued, with the exception of `locked`, which will be filled using the following functions:

`lock_pairs`
:
1. Let's start from our highest order function, `lock_pairs`. Which will check if adding a pair will create a cycle. If it does, we mark it as false to exclude it from `locked`.

```bash
void lock_pairs(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < pair_count; i++)
    {
        // temporarily lock pair
        locked[pairs[i].winner][pairs[i].loser] = true;
        // checks for
        if (has_cycle())
        {
            // unlocks pair
            locked[pairs[i].winner][pairs[i].loser] = false;
        }
    }
}
```

{:start="2"}
2. From the code above, the methodology is seemingly simple. We iterate through each pairing, check if the pairing creates a cycle when added, and lock the pairing if it it does not create a cycle.


`has_cycle`
:

Let's take a look at what `has_cycle` is doing when called on by `lock_pairs`. This is where the complexity ramps up. Try to remember our diagramming earlier to help understand what's going on.

1. We'll establish two new variables here. By declaring these locally to our function, it will reset every time `has_cycle` is called on, which we want. However, the values will remain as we call on our nested function, `dfs_cycle`.
- `visited` indicates which candidates we've already verified as fully processed and checked for cycles. So we can save time and skip anybody who has already been visited. Technically, we do not need this function, but it saves a huge amount of processing time for our code to skip the need to check candidates we have already visited.
- `inStack` indicates candidates that are currently being checked for a cycle. So if we come across a candidate and see that they are already marked as true for their corresponding inStack value, then we know that we've visited them before, meaning we have found a cycle.

2. For each candidate, we'll check if they have been visited, and call on our `dfs_cycle` function to perform a check for cycles if not

```bash
bool has_cycle()
{
    bool visited[MAX] = {0};
    bool inStack[MAX] = {0};

    for (int i = 0; i < candidate_count; i++)
    {
        if (!visited[i] && dfs_cycle(i, visited, inStack))
        {
            // found a cycle
            return true;
        }
    }
    // No cycle found
    return false;
}
```


`dfs_cycle`
:

Now let's get into the function we'll be calling over and over again, `dfs_cycle`

- Think of `has_cycle` as our initializer for checking cycles, setting values and creating our initial loop for each candidate
- Now, we are using `dfs_cycle` to perform the core logic of our depth first search. Returning `true` if it finds a cycle, which will cause our `has_cycle` function to also return `true` to indicate a cycle, since `dfs_cycle` is a condition of `has_cycle`

```bash
bool dfs_cycle(int candidate, bool visited[], bool inStack[])
{
    if (inStack[candidate])
        return true;

    if (visited[candidate])
        return false;

    visited[candidate] = true;
    inStack[candidate] = true;

    for (int i = 0; i < candidate_count; i++)
    {
        if (locked[candidate][i] && dfs_cycle(i, visited, inStack))
            // there is a cycle
            return true;
    }
    // no cycle
    inStack[candidate] = false;
    return false;
}
```

In this we do the following:

1. Check if the candidate is in our 'stack'. If they are, this means we have come across them earlier, and are therefore in a cycle. This will immediately exit our current function and tell our `has_cycle` function that there is a cycle[^fn2].

2. Check if the candidate has been visited. If they have, then we can return false, and move on to the next candidate to check.

3. Before we move on to the next candidate to check, we need to leave a paper trail of our traversal so we can remember what we've done. So we'll mark the candidate as in our stack and visited. 
- Once a candidate is marked as visited, they'll remain marked as visited until our entire DFS is complete. However, a candidate marked as inStack will be set back to false each time `dfs_cycle` is called, hence `inStack[candidate] = false;` in line 20 above.

4. Since we now know we have a candidate that is both not in our call stack and not visited, we can go to their neighbor and do a check. We only want to check neighbors that are actually locked into our graph, so our first condition will be if our neighbor, `i`, is locked in with our candidate. If they are, then we will execute our dfs_cycle on our neighbor `i`. We want to do this for each neighbor, so we'll wrap this code in a loop for each neighbor that the candidate being processed has.
- You've probably noticed that we are calling `dfs_cycle` within `dfs_cycle`. This is [recursion]({{ page.url | relative_url }}), it allows us to ensure that we check every candidate, and by the way we've setup our `dfs_cycle` function, it won't break itself or run forever. This function will end eventually, either once each candidate is marked as visited and we iterate through the loop of `has_cycle`, or if we find ourselves able to return to a candidate already in `inStack`, indicating we've found a cycle.


## How is this used in the real world?
The backbone of Google's original search engine was a DFS algorithm. Initially named "BackRub," Google's core technology enabled it to web crawl—or read through—every webpage it indexed. Using DFS, Google would delve into a webpage, follow links to other pages, and gather comprehensive information about them. Hence their original name. This allowed Google to understand the content of websites at a deeper level than other search engines, facilitating more accurate indexing and ranking. DFS is still essential to search for Google. Though likely embedded in more complex algorithms to enhance search.

Large language models like GPT rely on DFS to explore various responses to questions. The exploration performed by a DFS allows them to generate connections between letters, words, and sentences. An especially useful way of parsing the large amount of data these models are trained on.

## Footnotes

[^footnote]: I named the array 'pairs' as it seems like the plurality of struct 'pair'. Retrospectively, it would have been better to use a completely different name for our struct so that the user does not have to mentally juggle this distinction
[^fn2]: For simplicity, we will omit that returning `true` within a recursion will initially unwind the call stack of `dfs_cycle` before it returns `true` to `has_cycle`
